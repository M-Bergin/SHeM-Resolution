# SHeM-Resolution

MATLAB scripts and data to accompany manuscript titled Standardizing Resolution Definition in Scanning Helium Microscopy.

Two_Image_Diffractogram.m is the script for performing an estimate of the resolution using a Fourier space technique.

Horizontal_line_scans_v2.mlx is a live script for estimating the resolution using the square grating resolution standard, with the designs also included in a separate folder.

Beam_width_all.mlx is a live script to estimate the beam width at different positions.
